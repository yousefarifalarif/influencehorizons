<p>InfluenceHorizons is a platform that connects regional businesses with (micro-) influencers to establish collaborations for authentic social media marketing.<br>
As a team of 4 students ([Katie](github.com/katiekk), [Ethan](github.com/EthanHardwick), [Yousef](github.com/yousefarifalarif), [Max](github.com/MaxKern)), we have designed, implemented, and shipped this platform during the final project weeks at the Le Wagon Web Development Bootcamp in London.</p>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>InfluenceHorizons offers two user journeys: One for business customers and one for influencers.</p>
<p>It is used to make especially the life of regional business owners a lot easier because it saves them a lot of time, making it easier than ever to create a marketing campaign, to find authentic influencers for this campaign, to exchange information about and the current status of the campaign with the collaborators and to pay the influencer for his marketing efforts.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it enables micro-influencers with not much experience to easily find suitable campaigns, contact businesses, and receive collaborations for social media marketing campaigns.</p>
<h2 id="business-customers">Business Customers</h2>
<p>On InfluenceHorizons, a business customer can create projects for marketing campaigns and see the influencers and their bio who are registered on InfluenceHorizons.</p>
<p>A business user can then send proposals about one of his campaigns to influencers, asking them to collaborate.</p>
<p>As soon as the influencer accepted the proposal, they can chat with each other and exchange campaign-related information and documents with each other.</p>
<h2 id="influencers">Influencers</h2>
<p>On InfluenceHorizons, an influencer can have a look at the public campaigns of all the companies that are registered on the platform.</p>
<p>They can then send a proposal to collaborate on a specific campaign to the business. As soon as the business accepted the proposal, they can chat with each other and exchange campaign-related information and documents with each other.</p>
<h2 id="feedback">Feedback</h2>
